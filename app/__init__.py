# This file makes the 'app' directory a Python package.
# You can optionally import key components here for easier access from outside the package, e.g.:
# from .main import app
# from . import models, schemas
# from .database import engine, SessionLocal, Base, get_db
# from .core.config import settings

# For now, let's keep it simple.
# Ensure your models are imported somewhere before Alembic tries to use them, 
# often by importing Base into your main Alembic env.py or by importing models here.

# from .database import Base # Ensure Base is known for Alembic
# from . import models # This will ensure all models are registered with Base.metadata
